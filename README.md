# LaTeX-ChicagoReedWeb-mod

[ChicagoReedWeb](http://www.reed.edu/cis/help/files/ChicagoReedWeb.bst) is a fantastic BibTeX style! However, there were a couple things that I needed to tweak to use this for thesis submission.

* Punctuation was slightly off for journal entries
* Formatting was slightly off for articles in a collection (book).

This style is my slight modification to fix these two issues.

## To install

Place ChicagoReedweb-mod.bst in your "texmf-local/bibtex/bst" directory

## To use

Include the following line in your .tex file.

```
\bibliographystyle{ChicagoReedweb-mod}
```
